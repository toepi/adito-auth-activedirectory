<p>Classes used for the Microsoft Active Directory Server implementation of an Adito User Database.</p>

<p>This implementation uses JAAS (the Java Authentication and Authorization Service) to access
an Active Directory Server for authenticating Adito users and retrieving user
information. </p>

<p>Active Directory makes use of LDAP and Kerberos for authentication.</p>

<p>Adito Users are loaded from the Windows Accounts available and Adito 
roles are loaded from the Windows Groups.</p>

<p>This is currently a read-only user database. Accounts may <b>NOT</b> be created, 
edited or deleted and passwords may <b>NOT</b> be changed from within the web
interface.</p>

<p>An amount of configuration is required such as the domain and the domain controller
to connect to.</p>
